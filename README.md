Cryptonix is a simple blockchain-based web application developed using C++, Javascript, Node.js, React.js, Firebase, and OpenSSL. The application is designed to provide a basic understanding of blockchain concepts such as transaction signing, Merkle trees, and a proof-of-work consensus algorithm. Users can create accounts, make secure transactions, view transaction history, and check balances, all hosted on a blockchain secured with cryptographic methods.

## Features
- **User Authentication:** Users can sign up, log in, and securely access their accounts.
- **Transaction Functionality:** Users can make transactions, which are securely signed and verified.S
- **Blockchain Integrity:** Each block contains multiple transactions and is hashed using SHA-256, forming a secure chain with Merkle trees for efficient transaction hashing.
- **Proof of Work:** Blocks are added based on a proof-of-work consensus, which secures the chain by requiring computational effort to validate blocks.
- **Transaction History and Balance:** Users can view their transaction history and balance within the application dashboard.

## Technologies
- **Backend:** C++ (core blockchain logic, transaction handling), Node.js (REST API)
- **Frontend:** Node.js (React for UI)
- **Database:** Firebase Firestore (user and transaction data)
- **Cryptography:** OpenSSL (SHA-256, signature generation and verification)
- **Hashing and Consensus:** Merkle trees and proof-of-work consensus algorithm

## Usage

1. **Sign Up and Login:**
   - Create a user account via the signup page.
   - Log in with registered credentials to access the dashboard.

2. **Dashboard Features:**
   - **Make a Transaction**: Specify recipient, amount, and initiate transactions.
   - **Transaction History**: View a history of previous transactions.
   - **Get Balance**: Check current balance based on transactions in the blockchain.

## Blockchain Implementation Details

- **Merkle Tree**: Each block contains a Merkle root of transaction hashes, ensuring integrity and efficient verification.
- **Proof of Work**: Blocks are added only after a valid proof-of-work hash is found, helping secure the chain.
- **Transaction Signing**: Transactions are cryptographically signed using OpenSSL, ensuring sender verification.
- **Block Structure**: Each block contains a previous block hash, Merkle root, and the current blockâ€™s transactions, forming a linked list structure.

## Future Improvements
- Implementing additional cryptographic mechanisms for enhanced security.
- Improving consensus efficiency and experimenting with other algorithms.
- Expanding functionality to handle multiple cryptocurrencies or digital assets.
- Adding an enhanced front-end UI for better user experience.
